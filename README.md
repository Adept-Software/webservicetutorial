You are an enterprize web application developer. You need to develp a scalable web based application platform with below features .
- First feature - User can create profile, provide personal details like name, email, phone number, face picture. Other than email and name all other attributes are optional.
- Second feature - It allows signed in user to upload the pics. Either drag and drop or user can select pictures. User can select maxium 11 pics at a time. The pics should get stored in storage system and insert the details into a database with uploader user id for easy retrieval. 
- After uploading System to recognize the faces and maintain a data in database with tag information. Tag will actually the list of website users whos face is matching with people in the uploaded pictures. All uploaded picture with human face to be tagged. Default tag will of the user who uploaded the pic, regardless if he or she is in the pic or not.

- Create a show picture module where user can access all the pictures uploaded by self and all other picture those have the user is part of or simply all pictures where logged in user is tagged.

- I would prefer some maintainable laguage Java technology is prefered unless it has any performance issues in implementing this requirement.
